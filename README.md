# Spring Boot Fake API

## Description

This repository contains a project of an API developed using Spring Boot and Java 20, showcasing my skills and knowledge in building robust and efficient applications. The application follows the MVC design pattern for clear and maintainable code organization. This API allows for full user management, providing capabilities for querying, deleting, updating, and creating users.

## Key Features

### Technologies Used
- Spring Boot
- Docker
- Java 20
- MVC Design Pattern

### Data Persistence
- JpaRepository is employed for streamlined database operations.
- Data persistence is managed through an H2 database, ensuring portability and easy execution without external configurations.

### API Documentation
- Swagger is used for documentation and easy exploration of API endpoints.
- [Link to Swagger](https://springbootfakeapi.onrender.com/swagger-ui/index.html)

If the provided Swagger link is not functional, you can also download the Docker image to run the API locally. Follow the instructions below:

#### Docker Image Download Instructions
1. Ensure Docker is installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

2. Open a terminal window.

3. Run the following command to pull the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker pull your-docker-image-repository:tag
4. Once the image is downloaded, run the Docker container
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 your-docker-image-repository:tag
5. Access the API documentation by opening your browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html.
   
## Next Steps

I am actively working on incorporating a front-end to enhance the documentation experience and facilitate understanding of the API's functionality. Stay tuned for future updates!
